Once found, a test for the presence of Firefox OS on the\ndevice can separate them from normal Android devices.\n\n## Installation\n\n### From git\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/mozilla/node-firefox-find-devices.git\ncd node-firefox-find-devices\nnpm install\n```\n\nIf you want to update later on:\n\n```bash\ncd node-firefox-find-devices\ngit pull origin master\nnpm install\n```\n\n### npm\n\n```bash\nnpm install node-firefox-find-devices\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```javascript\nfindDevices() // returns a Promise\n```\n\n### Finding devices\n\n```javascript\nvar findDevices = require('node-firefox-find-devices');\n\n// Return all listening runtimes\nfindDevices().then(function(results) {\n  console.log(results);\n});\n```\n\n## Running the tests\n\nAfter installing, you can simply run the following from the module folder:\n\n```bash\nnpm test\n```\n\nTo add a new unit test file, create a new file in the `tests/unit` folder. Any file that matches `test.*.js` will be run as a test by the appropriate test runner, based on the folder location.\n\nWe use `gulp` behind the scenes to run the test; if you don't have it installed globally you can use `npm gulp` from inside the project's root folder to run `gulp`.\n\n### Code quality and style\n\nBecause we have multiple contributors working on our projects, we value consistent code styles. It makes it easier to read code written by many people! :-)\n\nOur tests include unit tests as well as code quality (\"linting\") tests that make sure our test pass a style guide and [JSHint](http://jshint.com/). Instead of submitting code with the wrong indentation or a different style, run the tests and you will be told where your code quality/style differs from ours and instructions on how to fix it.\n\nThis program is free software; it is distributed under an\n[Apache License](https://github.com/mozilla/node-firefox-find-devices/blob/master/LICENSE).\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright (c) 2015 [Mozilla](https://mozilla.org)\n([Contributors](https://github.com/mozilla/node-firefox-find-devices/graphs/contributors)).\n",
