This can be forwarded to a host computer over USB\nusing ADB. This module takes care of that as necessary, reusing forwarded ports\nwhen possible.\n\n## Installation\n\n### From git\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/mozilla/node-firefox-forward-ports.git\ncd node-firefox-forward-ports\nnpm install\n```\n\nIf you want to update later on:\n\n```bash\ncd node-firefox-forward-ports\ngit pull origin master\nnpm install\n```\n\n### npm\n\n```bash\nnpm install node-firefox-forward-ports\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```javascript\nvar forwardPorts = require('node-firefox-forward-ports');\n\n// Forwards ports as necessary, while reusing existing ports.\n// Returns the list of devices annotated with details on forwarded ports.\nforwardPorts([\n  {id: '3739ced5'},\n  {id: 'full_keon'},\n  {id: 'full_unagi'}\n]).then(function(results) {\n  console.log(results);\n}).catch(function(err) {\n  console.error(err);\n});\n\n// forwardPorts() can also accept an options object, for future expansion\n// when additional options are supported.\nforwardPorts({\n  devices: [\n    {id: '3739ced5'},\n    {id: 'full_keon'},\n    {id: 'full_unagi'}\n  ]\n}).then(function(results) {\n  console.log(results);\n}).catch(function(err) {\n  console.error(err);\n});\n\n```\n\n## Example\n\nThis example uses [node-firefox-find-devices](https://github.com/mozilla/node-firefox-find-devices)\nto first assemble a list of connected Firefox OS devices. The output of\n`findDevices()` is basically what `forwardPorts()` expects for its `devices`\noption.\n\n```javascript\nvar findDevices = require('node-firefox-find-devices');\nvar forwardPorts = require('node-firefox-forward-ports');\n\nfindDevices().then(forwardPorts).then(function(results) {\n  console.log(results);\n});\n```\n\nThis example would result in output like the following, which consists of the\noutput of `findDevices()` altered to include a list of forward ports for each\ndevice.\n\n```javascript\n[\n  {\n    \"id\": \"3739ced5\",\n    \"type\": \"device\",\n    \"isFirefoxOS\": true,\n    \"ports\": [\n      {\n        \"local\": \"tcp:8001\",\n        \"remote\": \"localfilesystem:/data/local/debugger-socket\",\n        \"port\": \"8001\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThe listing of each device returned from `findDevices()` will be annotated with\na new `ports` property. This is a list of details on each port forwarded to the\ndevice.\n\nThe `local` property contains the local side of the port forward. If this is a\nTCP/IP port, then its numerical port can be found in the `port` property.\n\nThe `remote` property contains the remote side of the port forward, useful for\nfiltering and selecting particular kinds of forwarded ports. Currently, this\nmodule only supports Firefox remote debugging sockets - but that could expand\nin the future.\n\n## Running the tests\n\nAfter installing, you can simply run the following from the module folder:\n\n```bash\nnpm test\n```\n\nTo add a new unit test file, create a new file in the `tests/unit` folder. Any file that matches `test.*.js` will be run as a test by the appropriate test runner, based on the folder location.\n\nWe use `gulp` behind the scenes to run the test; if you don't have it installed globally you can use `npm gulp` from inside the project's root folder to run `gulp`.\n\n### Code quality and style\n\nBecause we have multiple contributors working on our projects, we value consistent code styles. It makes it easier to read code written by many people! :-)\n\nOur tests include unit tests as well as code quality (\"linting\") tests that make sure our test pass a style guide and [JSHint](http://jshint.com/). Instead of submitting code with the wrong indentation or a different style, run the tests and you will be told where your code quality/style differs from ours and instructions on how to fix it.\n\nThis program is free software; it is distributed under an\n[Apache License](https://github.com/mozilla/node-firefox-forward-ports/blob/master/LICENSE).\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright (c) 2015 [Mozilla](https://mozilla.org)\n([Contributors](https://github.com/mozilla/node-firefox-forward-ports/graphs/contributors)).\n",
