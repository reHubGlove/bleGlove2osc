  "readme": "# node-firefox-uninstall-app [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/mozilla/node-firefox-uninstall-app.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/mozilla/node-firefox-uninstall-app)\n\n> Uninstall an installed app on a runtime.\n\nThis is part of the [node-firefox](https://github.com/mozilla/node-firefox) project.\n\n*NOTE: This module is super experimental and the API is not totally stable yet. Use under your own responsibility.*\n\n## Installation\n\n### From git\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/mozilla/node-firefox-uninstall-app.git\ncd node-firefox-uninstall-app\nnpm install\n```\n\nIf you want to update later on:\n\n```bash\ncd node-firefox-uninstall-app\ngit pull origin master\nnpm install\n```\n\n### npm\n\n```bash\nnpm install node-firefox-uninstall-app\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```javascript\nuninstallApp(options) // returns a Promise\n```\n\nwhere `options` is a plain `Object` which must contain the following:\n\n* `manifestURL`: the manifest URL *in the client* (you must have obtained this after a call to <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/node-firefox-find-app\"><tt>node-firefox-find-app</tt></a>. It's something that looks like: `manifestURL: 'app://13ab1444-736d-8c4b-83a6-b83afb5f1ea4/manifest.webapp'` in the result from `findApp`.\n* `client`: the remote client from where we want to uninstall this app\n\nIf no `options` are provided, or if `options` is an empty `Object` (`{}`), then `uninstallApp` will fail (how can you uninstall *you don't know what app exactly* from *you don't know where*?)\n\n\n### Installing and uninstalling a packaged app on a simulator\n\n```javascript\nstartSimulator().then(function(simulator) {\n  connect(simulator.port).then(function(client) {\n    findApp({ client: client, manifest: manifest }).then(function(apps) {\n      console.log('Found', apps.length, 'apps');\n      Promise.all(apps.map(function(app) {\n        console.log('Uninstalling', app.manifestURL);\n        return uninstallApp({ manifestURL: app.manifestURL, client: client });\n      })).then(function(results) {\n        console.log('Installing', appPath);\n        installApp({ appPath: appPath, client: client }).then(function() {\n          findApp({ client: client, manifest: manifest }).then(function(app) {\n            var firstApp = app[0];\n            launchApp({ client: client, manifestURL: firstApp.manifestURL }).then(function(done) {\n              console.log('Launched app');\n            }, function(err) {\n              console.error('App could not be launched', err);\n            });\n          });\n        });\n      });\n    });\n  });\n});\n\n\n```\n\nYou can have a look at the `examples` folder for a complete example.\n\n## Running the tests\n\nAfter installing, you can simply run the following from the module folder:\n\n```bash\nnpm test\n```\n\nTo add a new unit test file, create a new file in the `tests/unit` folder. Any file that matches `test.*.js` will be run as a test by the appropriate test runner, based on the folder location.\n\nWe use `gulp` behind the scenes to run the test; if you don't have it installed globally you can use `npm gulp` from inside the project's root folder to run `gulp`.\n\n### Code quality and style\n\nBecause we have multiple contributors working on our projects, we value consistent code styles. It makes it easier to read code written by many people! :-)\n\nOur tests include unit tests as well as code quality (\"linting\") tests that make sure our test pass a style guide and [JSHint](http://jshint.com/). Instead of submitting code with the wrong indentation or a different style, run the tests and you will be told where your code quality/style differs from ours and instructions on how to fix it.\n\n## License\n\nThis program is free software; it is distributed under an\n[Apache License](https://github.com/mozilla/node-firefox-uninstall-app/blob/master/LICENSE).\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright (c) 2015 [Mozilla](https://mozilla.org)\n([Contributors](https://github.com/mozilla/node-firefox-uninstall-app/graphs/contributors)).\n\n",
