But there are placeholders in the code marked with `TODO: Windows` that indicate where the Windows code would need to be added. If you want to contribute, those are the *gaps* that need to be filled in order for this to work on Windows.\n\n**NOTE**\n\n*This is a work in progress. Things will probably be missing and broken while we move from `fxos-findapp` to `node-firefox-find-app`. Please have a look at the [existing issues](https://github.com/mozilla/node-firefox-find-app/issues), and/or [file more](https://github.com/mozilla/node-firefox-find-app/issues/new) if you find any! :-)*\n\n## Installation\n\n### From git\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/mozilla/node-firefox-find-app.git\ncd node-firefox-find-app\nnpm install\n```\n\nIf you want to update later on:\n\n```bash\ncd node-firefox-find-app\ngit pull origin master\nnpm install\n```\n\n### npm\n\n<!--\n```bash\nnpm install node-firefox-find-app\n```\n-->\n\nThis module is not on npm yet.\n\n## Usage\n\n```javascript\nfindApp(options) // returns a Promise\n```\n\nwhere `options` is a plain `Object` which must contain the following:\n\n* `manifest`: the manifest contents, in JSON format\n* `client`: the remote client where we want to find if this app is installed\n\nIf no `options` are provided, or if `options` is an empty `Object` (`{}`), then `findApp` will fail (how can you find *you don't know what app exactly* in *you don't know where*?)\n\n\n### Finding apps in simulators, using the manifest JSON contents\n\n```javascript\nvar findApp = require('node-firefox-find-app');\nvar startSimulator = require('node-firefox-start-simulator');\nvar connect = require('node-firefox-connect');\nvar manifest = loadJSON('/path/to/manifest.webapp'));\n\nstartSimulator().then(function(simulator) {\n\n  connect(simulator.port).then(function(client) {\n\n    findApp({\n      manifest: manifest,\n      client: client\n    }).then(function(result) {\n\n      if (result.length === 0) {\n        console.log('App is not installed');\n      } else {\n        console.log('Found app!', result);\n      }\n\n      client.disconnect();\n      stopSimulator(simulator);\n\n    });\n\n  });\n\n});\n\n\n```\n\nYou can have a look at the `examples` folder for a complete example.\n\n## Running the tests\n\nAfter installing, you can simply run the following from the module folder:\n\n```bash\nnpm test\n```\n\nTo add a new unit test file, create a new file in the `tests/unit` folder. Any file that matches `test.*.js` will be run as a test by the appropriate test runner, based on the folder location.\n\nWe use `gulp` behind the scenes to run the test; if you don't have it installed globally you can use `npm gulp` from inside the project's root folder to run `gulp`.\n\n### Code quality and style\n\nBecause we have multiple contributors working on our projects, we value consistent code styles. It makes it easier to read code written by many people! :-)\n\nOur tests include unit tests as well as code quality (\"linting\") tests that make sure our test pass a style guide and [JSHint](http://jshint.com/). Instead of submitting code with the wrong indentation or a different style, run the tests and you will be told where your code quality/style differs from ours and instructions on how to fix it.\n\n## History\n\nThis is based on initial work on [fxos-findapp](https://github.com/nicola/fxos-findapp) by Nicola Greco.\n\n## License\n\nThis program is free software; it is distributed under an\n[Apache License](https://github.com/mozilla/node-firefox-find-app/blob/master/LICENSE).\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright (c) 2015 [Mozilla](https://mozilla.org)\n([Contributors](https://github.com/mozilla/node-firefox-find-app/graphs/contributors)).\n\n",
